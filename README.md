# Starfield Simulation üåå

This project is a p5.js sketch that simulates a starfield with scattered white stars of different sizes. The stars move in the direction of the mouse, with a smooth transition to multi-directional movement. When the mouse stops moving, the stars gradually slow down.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Continuous Movement**: Stars move continuously in the direction relative to the center of the window based on mouse position.
- **Smooth Transition**: Smooth transition from forward to multi-directional movement.
- **Adjustable Speed**: Central forward speed can be controlled and is faster by default.
- **Dynamic Interaction**: Stars slow down after 5 seconds of no mouse movement.

Quick GPT-4o p5.js Trial ‚è±Ô∏è

This project was created as a quick trial to demonstrate the capabilities of GPT-4 in generating a p5.js project. The entire implementation and adjustments were completed in less than 30 minutes. Ideation to Proof of Concept :)
